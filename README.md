# Mathdown
MathJax + MarkDown = MathDown.

As simple as that. The most minimalistic GitHub-flavoured MarkDown editor,
with MathJax support with LaTeX/AsciiMath input, in a webbrowser.

## Usage
Directly type in all the MarkDown. Enclose your AsciiMath with single dollars (`$`),
and LaTeX with backticks ('`'). Try it live: https://shivaprsdv.github.io/mathdown/mathdown.html
